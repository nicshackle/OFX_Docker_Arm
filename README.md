Run openframeworks on a Raspberry Pi 4! And perhaps on other ARM-based systems, but this repo has only been tested on a RPi4. 

One of the OFX examples is included for demonstration purposes.

## Usage
> Docker should be installed before proceeding
```bash
$ sudo docker build -t of .
[Note: takes a long time!]
